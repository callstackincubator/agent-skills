# Agent Skills

Markdown-only repo with agent skills for React Native and GitHub workflows. No build step.

## Adding New Skills

Follow [agentskills.io spec](https://agentskills.io/specification) and [Claude Code best practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices).

### Quick Checklist

1. Create `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Directory name must match `name` field exactly
3. Required frontmatter:
   ```yaml
   ---
   name: skill-name          # lowercase, hyphens only, 1-64 chars
   description: Third person description of what it does. Use when [trigger conditions].
   ---
   ```
4. Optional frontmatter: `license`, `metadata` (author, tags), `compatibility`
5. Keep body under 500 lines
6. Use markdown links: `[file.md](references/file.md)` not bare filenames
7. Run `/validate-skills` to verify

### What Makes a Good Skill

- **Concise**: Only add context Claude doesn't already have
- **Third person description**: "Processes X" not "I help with X"
- **What + When**: Description says what it does AND when to use it
- **One-level deep**: Reference files link from SKILL.md, not from other references
- **No redundancy**: Don't repeat description content in body
